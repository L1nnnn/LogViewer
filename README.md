## LogViewer

LogViewer is a simple log viewer for Linux. It displays the logs in a panel to the side, and allows you to view them in the main text area. This is the first version, so it is very simple at this point.

#### Building/Installing
LogViewer uses the CMake build system. The program is written in C++, so you will need a compiler. The GUI uses Gtkmm, version 3, so make sure you have those installed. I would highly recommend that you build everything in a separate build directory. To install, simply run "make install."

#### Development
The stable code (as of the latest release) is in the master branch. The code for the current program can be found in the dev branch. Any other branches that might appear are for special purposes.
